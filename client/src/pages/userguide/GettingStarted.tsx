                    <li>Polygon Â <em>(Beginner-friendly due to low transaction fees)</em></li>

                <h2>You need the following to use Meta-Op Game:</h2>
                <h6><strong>1) A cryptocurrency wallet</strong></h6>
                <p className="paragraph-user-guide">Meta-Op Game is compatible with a wide variety of crypto wallets. Some of the most common are <a href="https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-Started-With-MetaMask" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="link-9">Metamask</a> and <a href="https://learn.rainbow.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="link-11">Rainbow</a> <br />Follow one of the links for more information on setting up and securing your wallet. If you want to deposit on Optimism, Ethereum Goerli or Polygon, you first have to add the network to your wallet. You can do this in the Meta-Op Game dApp, by choosing the Network in the top right corner. </p>
                <h6><strong>1) USDC</strong></h6>
                <p className="paragraph-user-guide">Meta-Op Game allows you to deposit USDC on the aforementioned networks. </p>
                <p className="paragraph-user-guide">You can get USDC on Centralized Exchanges, Decentralized Exchanges, or a FIAT Onramp to buy it directly from your bank account or credit card. You can follow the guides for <Link to="/userguide/network/optimism/" className="link-13">Optimism</Link> or <Link to="/userguide/network/polygon/" className="link-14">Polygon</Link>.</p>
                <h6><strong>3) The network&#x27;s native Gas Token</strong></h6>
                <p className="paragraph-user-guide">Depositing, claiming prizes, and withdrawing requires a transaction and will cost a network fee.</p>
                <p className="paragraph-user-guide">To deposit, you need a small amount of the network&#x27;s native gas token in your wallet to cover the transaction fees.</p>
