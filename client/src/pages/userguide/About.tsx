                <p className="paragraph-user-guide">Meta-Op Game is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize-linked_savings_account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="link">prize savings</a> protocol, enabling you to win by saving. </p>
                <ul className="list">
                    <li>Deposit USDC for a chance to win</li>
                    <li>Participate in daily quick games in order to get a chance to win a prize if you are within the best scores</li>

                </ul>
                <p className="paragraph-user-guide">Every depositor has the same chance to win the contest, as it&#x27;s only based on your ability to be ranked within the best scores of the day, but the reward you will get is also correlated to the amount you have deposited. The more you save, the higher is your reward when you win a prize ! The difference between Meta-Op Game and other prize savings protocols such as lottery, is that our model is based on the competence, not on luck. Everyone can make the difference.<br /><br />Meta-Op Game is the only GameFi where you can earn money without taking the risk of loosing any ! </p>
                <h2>How does it work ?</h2>
                <p className="paragraph-user-guide">This is possible because prizes are made up of the interest that accrues on all deposited funds :</p>
                <p>🏦 Users deposit into the network<br />📈 Yield accrues on all deposits<br />🏆 The yield is awarded as prizes to the users.</p>

                <h4>Fully non-custodial</h4>

                <h4>Open source &amp; secure</h4>
                <p className="paragraph-user-guide">The protocol is made up of computer software: smart contracts living on the blockchain. The <a href="https://github.com/pgrandne/nopoolnogame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="link-2">code is open-source</a> for everyone to verify and validate. On top of that Meta-Op Game will undergo regular audits.</p>
                <h4>Decentralized</h4>
                <p className="paragraph-user-guide">Meta-Op Game is user-owned and user-driven. Control over the protocol rests in the hands of the community holding the NPNG token (will be developped later on).
